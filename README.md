/***************** ADC Live Plotting & Logging *********************

Some quick code created to pull ADC values in through the M2 microcontroller [http://medesign.seas.upenn.edu/index.php/Guides/MaEvArM] to Matlab on a computer.  Values are then plotted and logged.
Pin F0 of the M2 microcontroller is used in this setup.
